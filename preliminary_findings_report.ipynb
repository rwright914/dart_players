    "* With competitive darts being most popular in the UK and Netherlands in general, it is likely to see higher performance rankings by competitors from those countries.  Countries of lower player representation seem to produce competitors of lower PDC performance rank.  This may be result partially from the fact that darts are not a prominent part of that countries larger culture."

    "* Possessing a full Tour Card indicates that the player is currently within  the top 64 player rankings based on the Professional Darts Corporation's Order of Merit system, where as \"2 Year\" card status indicates newcomer or \"up-and-coming\" status, and No card indicates that they are neither in the top 64, nor have they won a card entrance spot through competition in the PDC Qualifying School.  Players who win a card through the Q-School have their ranking reset to zero.  (It is unclear to me if the \"0\" would be of high or low standing.  It is possible that if the 0 is representative of \"high standing\", there may need to be further discussion on some base assumptions of ranking value.)"
